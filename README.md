# python_demo

Dear readers,

This repository contains two small python projects.
These projects are short so as to be easily readable by the user.

The first 'mosaique' generates a mosa誰que of pictures to resemble a selected picture.
The second 'steganography', hides a picture behind another.

## Mosa誰que

This project is given in notebook format to show a little diversity.
Generating the mosa誰que can take a few minutes...

Please note that this program uses a lot of pictures to generate mosa誰que, thus the repository is quite heavy.


## Steganography

This project consists of an encoder and decoder.

The encoder hides an image behind another, feel free to use your own pictures.
A few pictures are given for user to use and experiment with.

The decoder takes the encoded image and extracts to hidden image.
